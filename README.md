## Software requirements

### 2D gameplay and graphics

- Easier to develop and more likely to fit into our internship time constraints.
- Generally more performant than 3d, which means the project could run smoothly on a wider range of devices.

### Compiles and runs on WebGL using WASM

- Compile once, run everywhere.
- WASM is new faster, smaller and more memory-efficient web runtime.
- People are more likely to play when they do not have to download anything on their machines.
- Ease of distribution through simple link share.

### Short playthrough duration

- Due to our time constraints, it is better to focus on making a short but memorable experience rather than long and somewhat monotonous.
- As most of the testers are not expected to be hardcore players, they might not have enough stamina to play for a longer amount of times. Around 15-20 minutes should work.

## Gameplay description

### Plot

Player has to go trough 3 areas. Each of those areas provides player ship with a new module, and provides obstacles that need to be bypassed using the module. On each of the areas there are 3 keys that need to be collected by player in order to open a gate towards the next area. After collecting those 3 areas and getting full ship functionality player will be teleproted to the last area. In the last area he will fight a small battle agains simple enemies. Two endings are possible: either player defeats all the enemies and open exit gate, or he is defetead by enemies. None of the endings is to be considered a lose, and we need to convey that feeling of accomplishment to player.

### Area 1: Nebula

Player obtains *light* module. In this area player has to naviagate trough some sort of maze convered by nebula. Nothing very challenging, just getting used to controls.

### Area 2: Wormhole

Player obtains *burst* module. This module allows player to perform short distance jumps by applying impulse force. In this area player needs to collect keys while oribiting around wormhole ad resisting its gravitational forces.

### Area 3: Meteors

Player obstains *cannon* module. This is basic shooting. The area is being constaintly exposed to meteorite rain and player needs to destroy some of those meterites to get keys.

### Area 4: Onslaught

In this area player defends sun from wave of space monsters.
