## Software requirements

### 2D gameplay and graphics

- Easier to develop and more likely to fit into our internship time constraints.
- Generally more performant than 3d, which means the project could run smoothly on a wider range of devices.

### Compiles and runs on WebGL using WASM

- Compile once, run everywhere.
- WASM is new faster, smaller and more memory-efficient web runtime.
- People are more likely to play when they do not have to download anything on their machines.
- Ease of distribution through simple link share.

### Short playthrough duration

- Due to our time constraints, it is better to focus on making a short but memorable experience rather than long and somewhat monotonous.
- As most of the testers are not expected to be hardcore players, they might not have enough stamina to play for a longer amount of times. Around 15-20 minutes should work.
